# Cracking_The_Coding_Interview
Excercises from the book Cracking The Coding Interview I've been working on. Mostly in Python

I work on programming interview questions and implement data structures from scratch in Python.
Some Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Trees and Graphs etc..

Some example questions: 
2.2 Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
2.3 Implement an algorithm to delete a node in th emiddle of a singly linked list, given access only to that node.
4.4 Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all nodes at each depth. 
11.6 Given an M x N matrix in which each row and each column is sorted, write a method to find an element.
18.1 Write a function that adds two numbers. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators.
